    Parameters:
    month(int) :         An Integer which represent the month you would like to generate the report for (all months are now in 2020, januari = 1 etc.)
    market_party(str):   String which defines the name of the market party you want to create the report for, Indicate None if you want to generate reports for all market parties
    update_data(bool):   Boolean which defines if the data needs to be updated, if True all excel files will be merged together in one csv file, if False the last update csv file will be used
                         Note that updating from the excel files will take some time
    report_type:         Indicate the type of report you would like to produce
                         'marketparty_month': generates reports for each market party per month
                         'general_month': generates a report which overviews all market parties during the indicated month (market party names are anonymized)
                         'general_year': generates a report which overviews all market parties during the entire year (market party names are annonymized)
                         'tennet_month': generates a report which overviews all market parties during the indicated month (market party names are visible), this document is intended for internal purposes
                         'tennet_year': generates a report which overviews all market parties during the entire year (market party names are visible), this document is intended for internal purpose only
                         'tennet_wind_month':generates a report which overviews all wind assets during the indicated month (market party names are visible), this document is intended for internal purposes
                         'tennet_wind_year':generates a report which overviews all wind assets during the entire year (market party names are visible), this document is intended for internal purpose only
    data_file_location:  Indicates the location of the datafile which is used for making the reports. By default a dummy data file is in place which can be used to run the script (dummy_data.csv).
                         The dummy file can be used as a template to put your own prognosis and measuring data.

    Returns:
    The function returns no variables
